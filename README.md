# LDAP
I'd like to use the People database as an LDAP server for contact applications, like an IP-PBX.
I am not an app developer, nor do I know any code at all. I am just a system integrator and administrator, and our church uses
PCO People as our main database. I would like my phone system to use it as its server for the phonebook, because I don't want
to create and maintain a differnet contact database. We use 3CX as our VoIP phone system/IP-PBX. LDAP is not the only protocol
that 3CX PBX's use for directory sync, so it doesn't HAVE to be LDAP. LDAP just seems to be the most adaptable. 
I asked PCO about it, and they directed me here. I'm way out of my league, but if anyone is working on something similar or 
sees this need, please let me know.
